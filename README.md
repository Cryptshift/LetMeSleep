# LetMeSleep
This project allows for a discord message to be sent to someone who is NOT LETTING YOU SLEEP. Well,  if they are being a bit too loud, perhaps playing league or somthing. It will send them a message through discord with the decibels that they are emitting and tell them to be quiet! Very useful if you have roommates or live in an apartment.
