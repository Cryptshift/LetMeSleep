# LetMeSleep
This project allows for a discord message to be sent to someone who is NOT LETTING YOU SLEEP. Well,  if they are being a bit too loud, perhaps playing league or somthing. It will send them a message through discord with the decibels that they are emitting and tell them to be quiet! Very useful if you have roommates or live in an apartment.

## How to use
1. Clone the repository
2. Insert into Xcode or Playgrounds
3. Run the code
4. Make sure to change the discordToken and User ID to your bots token and the user you want to send the message to respectively
