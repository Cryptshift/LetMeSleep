# LetMeSleep
This application project allows for a discord message to be sent to someone who is NOT LETTING YOU SLEEP. Well, rather then are being a bit to loud, maybe playing league or smth. It will send them a messasge through discord with the decibels that they are emitting and tell them to be quiet! Very useful if you have roommates or live in an apartment.
